# Tree and Algorithms

This repository has some implementation of algorithms that use trees as a data structure.

See a list of implemented algorithms:

 - Huffman Coding

# How to setup

There is no dependency on other libraries besides the standard c++ library, so you only need a compiler to run this repository.

Installing a compiler:

```sh
apt-get update
apt-get -y install g++ 
```

After that, you can compile/run using the Makefile. For example, to run the huffman coding algorithm, type:

```sh
make run-huffman-coding
```
